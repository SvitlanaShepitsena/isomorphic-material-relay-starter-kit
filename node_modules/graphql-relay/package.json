  "readme": "# Relay Library for GraphQL.js\n\nThis is a library to allow the easy creation of Relay-compliant servers using\nthe [GraphQL.js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) reference implementation\nof a GraphQL server.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/graphql/graphql-relay-js.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/graphql/graphql-relay-js)\n[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/graphql/graphql-relay-js/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/graphql/graphql-relay-js?branch=master)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nA basic understanding of GraphQL and of the GraphQL.js implementation is needed\nto provide context for this library.\n\nAn overview of GraphQL in general is available in the\n[README](https://github.com/facebook/graphql/blob/master/README.md) for the\n[Specification for GraphQL](https://github.com/facebook/graphql).\n\nThis library is designed to work with the \n[GraphQL.js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js) reference implementation\nof a GraphQL server.\n\nAn overview of the functionality that a Relay-compliant GraphQL server should\nprovide is in the [GraphQL Relay Specification](https://facebook.github.io/relay/docs/graphql-relay-specification.html)\non the [Relay website](https://facebook.github.io/relay/). That overview\ndescribes a simple set of examples that exist as [tests](src/__tests__) in this\nrepository. A good way to get started with this repository is to walk through\nthat documentation and the corresponding tests in this library together.\n\n## Using Relay Library for GraphQL.js\n\nInstall Relay Library for GraphQL.js\n\n```sh\nnpm install graphql-relay\n```\n\nWhen building a schema for [GraphQL.js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js),\nthe provided library functions can be used to simplify the creation of Relay\npatterns.\n\n### Connections \n\nHelper functions are provided for both building the GraphQL types\nfor connections and for implementing the `resolve` method for fields\nreturning those types.\n\n - `connectionArgs` returns the arguments that fields should provide when they\nreturn a connection type that supports bidirectional pagination.\n - `forwardConnectionArgs` returns the arguments that fields should provide\nwhen they return a connection type that only supports forward pagination.\n - `backwardConnectionArgs` returns the arguments that fields should provide\nwhen they return a connection type that only supports backward pagination.\n - `connectionDefinitions` returns a `connectionType` and its associated\n`edgeType`, given a node type.\n - `connectionFromArray` is a helper method that takes an array and the\narguments from `connectionArgs`, does pagination and filtering, and returns\nan object in the shape expected by a `connectionType`'s `resolve` function.\n - `connectionFromPromisedArray` is similar to `connectionFromArray`, but\nit takes a promise that resolves to an array, and returns a promise that\nresolves to the expected shape by `connectionType`.\n - `cursorForObjectInConnection` is a helper method that takes an array and a\nmember object, and returns a cursor for use in the mutation payload.\n\nAn example usage of these methods from the [test schema](src/__tests__/starWarsSchema.js):\n\n```js\nvar {connectionType: ShipConnection} =\n  connectionDefinitions({nodeType: shipType});\nvar factionType = new GraphQLObjectType({\n  name: 'Faction',\n  fields: () => ({\n    ships: {\n      type: ShipConnection,\n      args: connectionArgs,\n      resolve: (faction, args) => connectionFromArray(\n        faction.ships.map((id) => data.Ship[id]),\n        args\n      ),\n    }\n  }),\n});\n```\n\nThis shows adding a `ships` field to the `Faction` object that is a connection.\nIt uses `connectionDefinitions({nodeType: shipType})` to create the connection\ntype, adds `connectionArgs` as arguments on this function, and then implements\nthe resolve function by passing the array of ships and the arguments to\n`connectionFromArray`.\n\n### Object Identification\n\nHelper functions are provided for both building the GraphQL types\nfor nodes and for implementing global IDs around local IDs.\n\n - `nodeDefinitions` returns the `Node` interface that objects can implement,\nand returns the `node` root field to include on the query type. To implement\nthis, it takes a function to resolve an ID to an object, and to determine\nthe type of a given object.\n - `toGlobalId` takes a type name and an ID specific to that type name,\nand returns a \"global ID\" that is unique among all types.\n - `fromGlobalId` takes the \"global ID\" created by `toGlobalID`, and returns\nthe type name and ID used to create it.\n - `globalIdField` creates the configuration for an `id` field on a node.\n - `pluralIdentifyingRootField` creates a field that accepts a list of\nnon-ID identifiers (like a username) and maps then to their corresponding\nobjects.\n\nAn example usage of these methods from the [test schema](src/__tests__/starWarsSchema.js):\n\n```js\nvar {nodeInterface, nodeField} = nodeDefinitions(\n  (globalId) => {\n    var {type, id} = fromGlobalId(globalId);\n    return data[type][id];\n  },\n  (obj) => {\n    return obj.ships ? factionType : shipType;\n  }\n);\n\nvar factionType = new GraphQLObjectType({\n  name: 'Faction',\n  fields: () => ({\n    id: globalIdField(),\n  }),\n  interfaces: [nodeInterface]\n});\n\nvar queryType = new GraphQLObjectType({\n  name: 'Query',\n  fields: () => ({\n    node: nodeField\n  })\n});\n```\n\nThis uses `nodeDefinitions` to construct the `Node` interface and the `node`\nfield; it uses `fromGlobalId` to resolve the IDs passed in in the implementation\nof the function mapping ID to object. It then uses the `globalIdField` method to\ncreate the `id` field on `Faction`, which also ensures implements the\n`nodeInterface`. Finally, it adds the `node` field to the query type, using the\n`nodeField` returned by `nodeDefinitions`.\n\n### Mutations\n\nA helper function is provided for building mutations with\nsingle inputs and client mutation IDs.\n\n - `mutationWithClientMutationId` takes a name, input fields, output fields,\nand a mutation method to map from the input fields to the output fields,\nperforming the mutation along the way. It then creates and returns a field\nconfiguration that can be used as a top-level field on the mutation type.\n\nAn example usage of these methods from the [test schema](src/__tests__/starWarsSchema.js):\n\n```js\nvar shipMutation = mutationWithClientMutationId({\n  name: 'IntroduceShip',\n  inputFields: {\n    shipName: {\n      type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString)\n    },\n    factionId: {\n      type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLID)\n    }\n  },\n  outputFields: {\n    ship: {\n      type: shipType,\n      resolve: (payload) => data['Ship'][payload.shipId]\n    },\n    faction: {\n      type: factionType,\n      resolve: (payload) => data['Faction'][payload.factionId]\n    }\n  },\n  mutateAndGetPayload: ({shipName, factionId}) => {\n    var newShip = {\n      id: getNewShipId(),\n      name: shipName\n    };\n    data.Ship[newShip.id] = newShip;\n    data.Faction[factionId].ships.push(newShip.id);\n    return {\n      shipId: newShip.id,\n      factionId: factionId,\n    };\n  }\n});\n\nvar mutationType = new GraphQLObjectType({\n  name: 'Mutation',\n  fields: () => ({\n    introduceShip: shipMutation\n  })\n});\n```\n\nThis code creates a mutation named `IntroduceShip`, which takes a faction\nID and a ship name as input. It outputs the `Faction` and the `Ship` in\nquestion. `mutateAndGetPayload` then gets an object with a property for\neach input field, performs the mutation by constructing the new ship, then\nreturns an object that will be resolved by the output fields.\n\nOur mutation type then creates the `introduceShip` field using the return\nvalue of `mutationWithClientMutationId`.\n\n## Contributing\n\nAfter cloning this repo, ensure dependencies are installed by running:\n\n```sh\nnpm install\n```\n\nThis library is written in ES6 and uses [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) for ES5\ntranspilation and [Flow](http://flowtype.org/) for type safety. Widely\nconsumable JavaScript can be produced by running:\n\n```sh\nnpm run build\n```\n\nOnce `npm run build` has run, you may `import` or `require()` directly from\nnode.\n\nAfter developing, the full test suite can be evaluated by running:\n\n```sh\nnpm test\n```\n\nWhile actively developing, we recommend running\n\n```sh\nnpm run watch\n```\n\nin a terminal. This will watch the file system run lint, tests, and type\nchecking automatically whenever you save a js file.\n\nTo lint the JS files and run type interface checks run `npm run lint`.\n",

It has a simple API\nwith powerful features like lazy code loading, dynamic route matching,\nand location transition handling built right in. Make the URL your first\nthought, not an after-thought.\n\n**Important:** *This is the `master` branch of React Router and may contain changes that are not yet released. To see the code for the most recently published release, browse [the `latest` tag](https://github.com/rackt/react-router/tree/latest).*\n\n### Docs & Help\n\n- [Guides and API Docs](https://github.com/rackt/react-router/tree/latest/docs) (latest release)\n- [Change Log](/CHANGES.md)\n- [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/react-router)\n- [Codepen Boilerplate](http://codepen.io/anon/pen/xwQZdy?editors=001)\n  Please use for bug reports\n\n**Note:** *If you are still using React Router 0.13.x [the docs](https://github.com/rackt/react-router/tree/0.13.x/docs/guides) can be found on [the 0.13.x branch](https://github.com/rackt/react-router/tree/0.13.x). Upgrade information is available on the [change log](/CHANGES.md).*\n\nFor questions and support, please visit [our channel on Reactiflux](https://discord.gg/0ZcbPKXt5bYaNQ46) or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/react-router). The issue tracker is *exclusively* for bug reports and feature requests.\n\n### Browser Support\n\nWe support all browsers and environments where React runs.\n\n### Installation\n\nUsing [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):\n\n    $ npm install --save react-router\n\nThen with a module bundler like [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) that supports either CommonJS or ES2015 modules, use as you would anything else:\n\n```js\n// using an ES6 transpiler, like babel\nimport { Router, Route, Link } from 'react-router'\n\n// not using an ES6 transpiler\nvar Router = require('react-router').Router\nvar Route = require('react-router').Route\nvar Link = require('react-router').Link\n```\n\nThe UMD build is also available on [npmcdn](https://npmcdn.com):\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://npmcdn.com/react-router/umd/ReactRouter.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nYou can find the library on `window.ReactRouter`.\n\n### Versioning and Stability\n\nReact Router follows semver to the best of our interpretation of it. We want React Router to be a stable dependency that’s easy to keep current. Here is our upgrading strategy for your apps.\n\nAssuming we are currently on version 1.0:\n\n1. 2.0 is fully backward compatible with 1.0 so you can upgrade, and then update your code incrementally.\n2. All deprecated 1.0 API usage warns to the console and links to an upgrade guide.\n3. 3.0 will remove 1.0 deprecations completely.\n4. 3.0 will be released no sooner than three months after 2.0. This gives an API, in the worst case scenario, six months of life if you’re staying perfectly up-to-date.\n5. Some codemods that will automatically update your code will be available at rackt/rackt-codemod\n\n> If it’s fully backwards compatible, why isn’t that a minor release?\n\nIf we didn’t provide the backwards compatibility then you wouldn’t be asking this question — but then upgrading would break your app. We don’t want to break your app, we want smooth, incremental upgrades.\n\nIn practice, this means you can:\n\n1. Upgrade from 1.0 to 2.0 and your app will still run.\n2. Update your code incrementally to the new API, and you have three months before the next release to do it.\n3. Run the codemods to make some of (2) automatic.\n4. If your code runs without warnings, you can repeat this list with version 3.0\n\n### What's it look like?\n\n```js\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { render } from 'react-dom'\nimport { Router, Route, Link, browserHistory } from 'react-router'\n\nconst App = React.createClass({/*...*/})\nconst About = React.createClass({/*...*/})\n// etc.\n\nconst Users = React.createClass({\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <h1>Users</h1>\n        <div className=\"master\">\n          <ul>\n            {/* use Link to route around the app */}\n            {this.state.users.map(user => (\n              <li key={user.id}><Link to={`/user/${user.id}`}>{user.name}</Link></li>\n            ))}\n          </ul>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"detail\">\n          {this.props.children}\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n})\n\nconst User = React.createClass({\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.setState({\n      // route components are rendered with useful information, like URL params\n      user: findUserById(this.props.params.userId)\n    })\n  },\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <h2>{this.state.user.name}</h2>\n        {/* etc. */}\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n})\n\n// Declarative route configuration (could also load this config lazily\n// instead, all you really need is a single root route, you don't need to\n// colocate the entire config).\nrender((\n  <Router history={browserHistory}>\n    <Route path=\"/\" component={App}>\n      <Route path=\"about\" component={About}/>\n      <Route path=\"users\" component={Users}>\n        <Route path=\"/user/:userId\" component={User}/>\n      </Route>\n      <Route path=\"*\" component={NoMatch}/>\n    </Route>\n  </Router>\n), document.body)\n```\n\nSee more in the [Introduction](https://github.com/rackt/react-router/tree/latest/docs/Introduction.md), [Advanced Usage](https://github.com/rackt/react-router/tree/latest/docs/guides/advanced/README.md), and [Examples](https://github.com/rackt/react-router/tree/latest/examples).\n\n\n\n### Thanks\n\nThanks to [our sponsors](/SPONSORS.md) for supporting the development of\nReact Router.\n\nReact Router was initially inspired by Ember's fantastic router. Many thanks to the Ember team.\n\nAlso, thanks to [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) for providing the infrastructure that allows us to run our build in real browsers.\n\n[build-badge]: https://img.shields.io/travis/rackt/react-router/master.svg?style=flat-square\n[build]: https://travis-ci.org/rackt/react-router\n\n[npm-badge]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-router.svg?style=flat-square\n[npm]: https://www.npmjs.org/package/react-router\n\n[coveralls-badge]: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/rackt/react-router/master.svg?style=flat-square\n[coveralls]: https://coveralls.io/github/rackt/react-router\n\n[discord-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-join%20chat%20%E2%86%92-738bd7.svg?style=flat-square\n[discord]: https://discord.gg/0ZcbPKXt5bYaNQ46\n",

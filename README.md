# Isomorphic Material Relay Starter Kit (IMRSK)

IMRSK started as an off-shoot of multiple projects and boilerplates we use at [Code Foundries](http://codefoundries.com). It is an attempt to provide and organize a well thought out starting point for future projects. It also contains samples of techniques that tie all the underlying technologies together. Baseline functionality like user log in, authentication, etc. is included.

# WARNING: Since version 0.6.4 we changed the user_id s so the auth_token cookies are invalid and will crash the client. Please delete the cookies first.

Naturally the server should be able to figure it out. Coming soon to a repository near you.

## Articles

The following articles explain in detail certain aspects of this repository:

* [Cassandra, meet Relay. Relay, meet Cassandra](http://codefoundries.com/developer/cassandra/cassandra-meet-relay.html).
* [Isomorphic Server Variables](http://codefoundries.com/developer/single-page-application/isomorphic-server-variables.html).


## Underlying technologies

| **Technology** | **Description**|
|----------------|----------------|
| [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) | Library for building SPA. |
| [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/) | Library for implementing Material Design in React. All user interface in this kit is built exclusively with Material UI components. |
| [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/) | A Javascript framework for building data-driven react applications. |
| [GraphQL](https://facebook.github.io/graphql/) | A query language created by Facebook in 2012 for describing the capabilities and requirements of data models for client‐server applications. |
| [Express GraphQL](https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql) | A Node.js express library that allows the creation of GraphQL servers. |
| [Isomorphic Relay](https://github.com/denvned/isomorphic-relay) | Adds server side rendering support to React Relay. IMRSK fully utilizes this library, while waiting for [https://github.com/facebook/relay/issues/589](https://github.com/facebook/relay/issues/589). The eventual goal is to have full isomorphism with authentication. |
| [JWT](https://jwt.io/) | JSON Web Tokens is an industry standard [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) method for representing claims securely between two parties. |
| [React Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) | Reusable React component will manage all of your changes to the document head with support for document title, meta, link, script, and base tags. |
| [Babel](http://babeljs.io) | Compiles ES6/ES7 to ES5. Allows using features from ES6 and ES7 today. |
| [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io) | Bundles npm packages and the application Java Script into a single file. Includes hot reloading via [react-transform-hmr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-transform-hmr). Also, Webpack can bundle any required CSS. |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)| Event-driven, non-blocking I/O runtime based on JavaScript that is lightweight and efficient. |
| [npm Scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts)| Glues all this together in a handy automated build. |
| [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/) | The database you are looking for. Work in progress. |



## Features

| **Feature** | **Details**|
|-------------|------------|
| SPA | The IMRSK is a Single Page Application. It has all the advantages that come with SPA, while using isomorphism and the Relay features allows to offset practically all negatives that come with this approach. |
| Isomorphism | The kit is designed to be fully isomorphic. This allows for very quick rendering when the users first access a page in the application. All content is designed to be accessed in an isomorphic way allowing the use and sharing of links to any part of the SPA. |
| SEO | The combination of isomorphism with the use of the react helmet allows all the content in the application to be SEO ready. Samples will be added to the kit later. |
| ES6, ES7 | The IMRSK uses features of ES6 and ES7 extensively. All react components are implemented as ES6 classes. |
| JWT Tokens | JWT tokens are used for authentication. They are stored in server-only cookies which, together with the use of GraphQL, provides a fair amount of protection against several possible attacks. |
| HTTP Only cookies | The HTTP only cookies are currently the safest way to handle authentication in a web application. The JWT tokens are stored in HTTP only cookies making it harder for attackers to access. Why this is the best place is explained in [Where to Store Your JWTs - Cookies vs HTML5 Web Storage](https://stormpath.com/blog/where-to-store-your-jwts-cookies-vs-html5-web-storage/). |
| Material Design | Expanding upon the "card" motifs that debuted in Google Now, Material Design makes more liberal use of grid-based layouts, responsive animations and transitions, padding, and depth effects such as lighting and shadows. |
| Responsive Design | Mainly through the features of the Material UI library, the examples in IMRSK work well on different form factors, ranging from desktop browsers to mobile phones. |
| Hot Reload | The webpack development server supports hot reload when components are changed. The IMRSK is configured with hot reload. |
| Built for speed | The starter kit is configured to use established practices for optimizing speed like caching and compression. This entails certain requirements about how it is used, read in the Speed and Building section below. |
| Cassandra/In Memory | The starter kit is intended for use with Cassandra, but simple in-memory data structures are provided also for light testing and experimentation. |



### <a name="heroku-setup"></a> Heroku setup

In order to set up the project on heroku, perform the following steps:

* **Install [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)**.
* **Clone from github** `git clone https://github.com/codefoundries/isomorphic-material-relay-starter-kit`.
* **Create an app** `heroku create`.
* **Specify JWT secret** using `heroku config:set JWT_SECRET=tMMoDN3WCZWoV13wpBjUVcgLQRrCP3c3veNMMV5JlxNelC23oAja8eTVSzgK94LR9TpmLrwqGfuiSzOQ` where you replace the secret value with a secret of your choosing. Verify that the value is set with `heroku config`.
* **Deploy the app** `git push heroku master`.

For more information refer to excellent [Getting Started with Node.js on Heroku - Deploy the app](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#deploy-the-app). I do not have an available free Cassandra dyno on Heroku so I can not test how to configure Cassandra.

#### Running bash on Heroku

`heroku run bash` is your friend in need who is a friend indeed.

#### Troubleshooting unmet peer dependencies on Heroku

Whenever, when updating Heroku, an 'UNMET DEPENDENCY' message similar to the one below is displayed:

```
remote:        isomorphic-material-relay-starter-kit@0.7.2 /tmp/build_xxxxxxxxxxxx
remote:        ├─┬ material-ui@0.14.3
remote:        │ ├── inline-style-prefixer@0.6.7
remote:        │ └── UNMET PEER DEPENDENCY react@^0.14.3
remote:        ├── UNMET DEPENDENCY react@^0.14.6
remote:        ├── react-dom@0.14.7
remote:        └─┬ react-helmet@2.3.1
remote:        └── core-js@2.0.3
```

Try the following troubleshooting step from the Heroku troubleshooting manual: Each time you run `npm install`, npm leaves packages that meet your semver requirements untouched. That’s why an `npm install` today may lead to a different tree than the `npm install` you ran yesterday, even if your `package.json` didn’t change.
Therefore, it’s a good practice to periodically clear `node_modules` and reinstall from scratch to ensure that your` package.json` dependencies are still valid:

```
$ rm -rf node_modules
$ npm install --quiet --production
$ npm start
```

In fact, those are essentially the commands that Heroku runs when we build and launch your project. If they work locally, you’re likely to be cloud-ready.

If this does not work, running

```
npm shrinkwrap
```

will generate the `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file, which seems to resolve the above problem in most cases.

### <a name="local-setup"></a> Initial Development Machine Setup

* **Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)**.  
* **Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**.
* **Install [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/download/)**.

We have only tested this running on MacOS. I am copying the instructions for other operating systems from the **[React Slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot)**. We have not had a chance to test them and would appreciate help with that. If you have done that please open an issue with the results whether successful or not, and feel free to PR to update this document.

#### **On Linux**  
Run this to [increase the limit](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16748737/grunt-watch-error-waiting-fatal-error-watch-enospc) on the number of files Linux will watch. [Here's why](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot/issues/6).    
`echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p`

#### **On Windows**  
1. **Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**. Browser-sync (and various other Node modules) rely on node-gyp, which requires Python on Windows.  
2. **Install C++ Compiler**. [Visual Studio Express](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-US/products/visual-studio-express-vs) comes bundled with a free C++ compiler. Or, if you already have Visual Studio installed: Open Visual Studio and go to File -> New -> Project -> Visual C++ -> Install Visual C++ Tools for Windows Desktop. The C++ compiler is used to compile browser-sync (and perhaps other Node modules).

### Initial Project setup on local machine

In order to set up the project locally, perform the following steps:

* **Clone from github.** `git clone https://github.com/codefoundries/isomorphic-material-relay-starter-kit`.
* **Install node packages.** `npm install`.
* **Perform initial setup.** `npm run setup-local`.
* **Specify JWT_SECRET** by modifying the `.env` file. This step can be skipped if you do not care about the actual security and simply want to get the project running.
* **Start the server.** `npm run start`.
* **The application is available at:** `http://localhost:4444`.



## NPM tasks

### Setup

| **Task**               | **Details**|
|------------------------|------------|
| `postinstall`          | Called by NPM after `npm install`. Configures to use memory data access, re-builds the GraphQL schema and performs a webpack build. |
| `setup-local`          | Sets up the IMRSK for use on local dev machine. |
| `setup-cassandra-init` | Drops (if it exists), creates and initializes with sample data a local Cassandra database called `imrsk`. |
| `config-da-memory`     | Configure IMRSK for using in-memory data structures. |
| `config-da-cassandra`  | Configure IMRSK for using Cassandra for persistence. |

### Build

| **Task**               | **Details**|
|------------------------|------------|
| `build-schema`         | Rebuilds GraphQL schema from the JavaScript definition. |
| `build-mui-icon-list`  | Re-builds list of icons based on the ones available in Material-UI. If `if( key > 50 ) return;` is uncommented, all icons will be generated. It becomes quite the page and webpack voices objections, but it works. |
| `build-webpack`        | Runs a webpack build in order to run in production mode. Created and populates `public/assets/{Version}``. |

### Run

| **Task**               | **Details**|
|------------------------|------------|
| `start-webpack`        | Starts the webpack development server, responsible for asset compilation and hot reload. |
| `start-dev`            | Starts the application server in development mode. |
| `dev`                  | Starts the task at the same time: `start-webpack` and` start-dev`. The color coding achieved with chalk will not be available with this task. |
| `start`                | Run in production mode. |

### Running in development mode

Two separate servers need to be started. The first one is the actual application in development mode. The second server is the webpack server which is to be run at all times for hot replace

* Start application HTTP and Webpack server: `npm run dev`.

To open the app:

* Navigate to `http://localhost:4444`, unless you specified a different port.



## Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be used to control the server:

| Variable Name                  | Description                                                                                             |

## Speed and asset version control

This project configured to use compression on all content, and caching on the static content. This delivers spectacular results. The numbers below were obtained using Google Chrome, development tools throttling and cache disabling, on a 2011 series Macbook Pro. The test is performed on the main page. Instance [deployed on Heroku](http://isomorphic-material-relay.herokuapp.com/) was used.

| Network Speed                  | Initial load (no cache) | Subsequent load (cached content) |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| On Regular 2G (250 kb/s)       | 7.3 sec                 | 1.4 sec                          |
| On Regular 3G (750 kb/s)       | 3.1 sec                 | 1.1 sec                          |

In both cases the UI becomes visible in less than a second. The wait time is to get all the JavaScript loaded in order to continue working as an SPA.

While this is a desirable level of performance, it is important not to forget that caching the static content means caching the SPA code too. The assets generated with webpack are placed into a sub-folder bearing the version of the package as name. Make sure to increase the version number in `package.json` every time you deploy changes to production.

If you add other static content, you might want to revisit how caching of static content is implemented.
